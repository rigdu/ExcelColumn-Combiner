## Excel Combiner (E to AX)

A simple Tkinter tool to process Excel files:

- **Combines columns E to AX** (5th to 50th columns) into a single string in column E.
- **Drops columns F to AX** from the resulting file.
- Saves the output as `<original>_output.xlsx`.

### Usage

1. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python excel_combiner_e_ax.py
    ```
2. Select your `.xlsx` file.
3. The processed file will be saved in the same directory.
